// Artube serves the built game from a CDN path → RELATIVE asset URLs on build; the RGS lives on
// the SAME origin at `/api/rgs/…`, so there is no backend host to configure anywhere.
//
// The math (index.json + lookUpTable_* + books_*) lives in the top-level `math/` folder, OUTSIDE
// `public/`, so it never ships in `dist/`: upload `math/` to Artube Hub; Artube's pipeline builds
// `dist/` and puts it on the CDN. In dev the artubeplate plugin serves `math/` to the local mock RGS
// and validates it. A plain build never runs the mock (it has no math), so a deployed game opened
// without a session says so. `npm run build:demo` (`--mode demo`) is a standalone demo: the math
// ships in the build and the local mock plays it, from any folder of any static host. Never hand
// that build to Artube.
//
// Port 8080 is where Artube Hub's "Play on Localhost" opens the game.
